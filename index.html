    <h5>INFORMATION GOOGLE COLLECTS</h5>
    <h6>We want you to understand the types of <br>information we collect as you use our services</h6>


    <p>We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out <br>
      basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll <br>
      find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you <br>
      might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends <br>
      on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.</p>


      <p>When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with <br>
        unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using. This allows us <br>
         to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your <br>
         preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on <br> 
        your activity.</p>


        <p>When you’re not signed in to a Google <br>

        <p>
          When you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that <br>
          includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a phone number or <br>
          payment information to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account,<br>
          you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to receive <br>
          updates about our services.
        </p>

        <p>
          We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our <br>
          services.This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you <br>
          save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.

        <h5>Information we collect as you use our services</h5>
        <h4>Your apps,browsers & devices</h4>
        <img src="https://www.gstatic.com/policies/privacy/e79ea0ed464fc8952d5b5582f9f9ae53.svg" alt="">

        <p>We collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google <br>
          services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming <br>
          your screen if your battery runs low.

          <p>The information we collect includes unique identifiers, browser <br>
           type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name <br>
           and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about <br>
            the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP <br>
            address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your <br>
            request.</p>
          
          <p>We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — <br>
            for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for <br>
            automatic updates. If you’re using an Android device with Google apps, your device <br> 
            periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and <br>
            connection to our services. This information includes things like your device type and <br>
            carrier name, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device <br>
            settings, other information about how you’re using your Android device.</p>

\
<p> We collect information about your location when you use our services, which helps us <br>
  offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on <br>
  your general location.</p>

  <p>Your location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy by:</p>

<li>GPS and other sensor data from your device</li>
<li>IP address</li>
<li>Activity on Google service,such as your searches and places you label like home <br>
or work</li>
<li>Information about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, <br>
  and Bluetooth-enabled devices</li>

  <p>
    The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your <br>
    device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android device’s location on <br>
     or off using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on Location History if you <br>
      want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your <br>
      Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services,<br>
       which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account.<br>

  <p>
    In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly <br>
    accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s <br>
    Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your <br>
     name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as <br>
     directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s <br>
     services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers <br>
     of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to <br>
     protect against abuse. We also receive information from <br>
     advertising partners to provide advertising and research services on their behalf.

  <p>
    We use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel <br>
     tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases,<br>

  <h5>WHY GOOGLE COLLECTS DATA</h5>

  <h6>We use data to build better services</h6>

  <p>We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:</p>

  <div class="services">
  <h6>Provide our services</h6>
  <img src="https://www.gstatic.com/policies/privacy/b18d13e9ea8a362642b7d25bce665039.svg" alt="">
  
  <p>We use your information to deliver our services, like processing the terms you search for <br>
     in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your <br>
      contacts.</p>

      <div class="maintain">
      <h5>Maintain & improve our services</h5>
      <img src="https://www.gstatic.com/policies/privacy/4165cd3aa643abb80fe1953668f67551.svg" alt="">

      <p>
        We also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as <br>
        tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your <br>
        information to make improvements to our services — for example, understanding which <br>
        search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used <br>
        across our services.
      </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h6>Develop new services</h6>
  <img src="https://www.gstatic.com/policies/privacy/546f2b674b407304a2570e71a216e509.svg" alt="">
  <p>
    We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For <br>
    example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first<br>
     photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="personalized">
  <h5>Provide personalized services, including content and ads
  </h5>

  <img src="https://www.gstatic.com/policies/privacy/51cd09d6239edc9652bc05ad1d149a5c.svg" alt="">
  <p>
    We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing <br>
     recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results. For example, <br>
     Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And <br>
     Google Play uses information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve <br>
    watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.
  </p>
  <p>
    Depending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your <br>
    interests. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see an ad for sports <br>
    equipment when you’re browsing a site that shows ads served by Google. You can <br>
    control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings.
  </p>
  <li>We don’t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race,<br>
     religion, sexual orientation, or health.</li>
     <li>We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or<br>
       Photos.</li>
       <li>We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as<br>
         your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby ,<br>
         flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share<br>
         your phone number with the flower shop.</li>

  <p>
    We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. <br>
     For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize <br>
      product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with to help advertisers <br>
       understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this,<br>
        including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use <br>
         Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to link information about your <br>
          activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad <br>
     services.

  <div class="communication">

    <p>
      We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For <br>
       example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt <br>
        to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know <br> 
        about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, <br>
       we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.

    <h5>Protect Google, our users and the public</h5>
    <img src="https://www.gstatic.com/policies/privacy/02f8664b95445de6f27ba682f3c5f9ab.svg" alt="">
    
    <p>We use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This <br>
       includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and <br>
        technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.
    </p>
    <hr>
<p>We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use <br>
   automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized <br>
   search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services.,<br> 
   And we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal <br>
   content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google <br>
    Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language <br>
  patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.</p>

  <p>We may combine the information we collect among our services and across your devices <br>
     for the purposes described above. For example, if you watch videos of guitar players on <br>
      YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products.<br> 
      Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be <br>
      associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the <br>
    ads delivered by Google.</p>

    <p>If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we <br>
       may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and <br>
      photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.</p>
  
      <p>We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered <br>

      SHARING YOUR INFORMATION
    </div>

    <h5>When you share your information</h5>

    <p>Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control <br>
      over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can  <br>
      decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your <br>
       content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.</p>


       <p>When you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on <br>
        a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your <br>
        activity. We may also display this information in ads depending on your Shared <br>
        endorsements setting.</p>


        <h5>When Google shares your information</h5>

        <p>We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals <br>
           outside of Google except in the following cases:</p>


           
           <h5>With your consent</h5>

           <p>We’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For<br>
              example, if you use Google Home to make a reservation through a booking service,<br> 
               we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant.<br>
                We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any sensitive personal information.</p>


                <div class="domain administrator">


                <h5>With domain administrator</h5>


                <p>If you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your domain <br>
                  administrator and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google <br>
                  Account. They may be able to:</p>

                  <li>Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email</li>

                  <li>View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install</li>

                  <li>Change your account password</li>

                  <li>Suspend or terminate your account access</li>

                  <li>Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal <br>
                    process, or enforceable governmental request</li>

                    <li>Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings</li>

                  <h5>For External Processes</h5>

                  <P>We provide personal information to our affiliates and other trusted businesses or<br>
                     persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our <br>
                     Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For <br>
                     example, we use service providers to help operate our data centers, deliver our products<br>
                      and services, improve our internal business processes, and offer additional support to <br>
                      customers and users. We also use service providers to help review YouTube video <br>
                      content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help 
                    improve Google’s audio recognition technologies.</P>

                  <h5>For legal reasons</h5>

                  <p>We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that <br>
                     access, use, preservation, or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:</p>

                     <li>Meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental<br>
                       request. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive <br>
                      from governments in our Transparency Report.</li>

                      <li>Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.</li>

                      <li>Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.</li>

                      <li>Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users, or the <br>
                      public as required or permitted by law.</li>


                      <p>We may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners — <br>
                        like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share<br>
                         information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services. We also allow <br>
                         specific partners to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and <br>
                        measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.</p>

                        <p>If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure <br>
                          the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before <br>
                          personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
